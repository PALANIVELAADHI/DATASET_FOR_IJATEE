# Quantum Prioritized Experience Replay with MaDi-Based Priority and Quantum Circuit Mechanisms for Optimizing Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains datasets and results for the study on **Quantum Circuit-Based Priority Replay (QCPR)**. QCPR leverages quantum-inspired techniques to enhance the scalability and efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL).

---

## Overview

### **Key Features**
- **MaDi-Based Priority**: Evaluates experience significance and directionality.
- **Quantum Circuit Mechanisms**: Enables efficient experience replay.
- **Benchmarked Against**:
  - Q-Learning (QL)
  - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
  - Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
  - Dueling DQN (DDQN)

---

## Results

QCPR outperformed benchmarks with:
- **15.29% higher accuracy than QL.**

Applications include:
- Atari games
- Qiskit integration
- Raspberry Pi environments
